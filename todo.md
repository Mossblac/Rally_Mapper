# Rally Map Maker:

1. Learn Fyne for visualization and animation 
2. real world research, need a time vs distance ratio
3. define obstacles relations and estimate added time for each
4. define punch types and relations to obstacles

## collect equipment variables

- number of punches and variety 
- number of obstacles and all types available
- difficulty of course : rookie = no required obstacles to complete course, primary = 25% required, league = 50%, semi-pro = 75%  pro = 100% obstacles required


## visualize

1. define area in square feet, create grid. 
2. create course outline using all space available, option for loop or setting start and finish location
3. apply all obstacles while maintaining difficulty level
4. apply punches and calculate time reductions 

## store in database 
### create search function to access pregenerated maps based on variables.
